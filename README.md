## üìå Project Overview

This project is a **comprehensive cryptography laboratory**, developed to simulate the principles and applications of cryptographic algorithms in a web-based environment. Using **JavaScript**, **CryptoJS**, and the **WebCrypto API**, this lab implements a variety of modern and classical cryptographic mechanisms ‚Äî focusing on both their **correct and incorrect** usage to reinforce learning through vulnerability analysis and secure implementation.

The project consists of **40+ HTML-based interactive exercises**, paired with JavaScript scripts and styled with custom CSS. Tasks included developing and debugging cryptographic functionalities such as:

- AES (ECB, CBC, GCM)
- RSA (Key generation & encryption)
- DES, RC4 (and vulnerabilities)
- XOR ciphers
- PRNGs and entropy tests
- HMACs and keyed hashes
- File hashing and encryption
- Secure random number seeding

---

## üß† Learning Objectives

- Understand and apply **core cryptographic primitives**: confidentiality, integrity, authenticity
- Identify **insecure implementations** and apply security patches
- Gain hands-on experience with **WebCrypto API** for real-world use cases
- Analyze the **cryptographic lifecycle**, from key generation to secure storage
- Apply **OWASP** and **ISO/IEC 27001** aligned secure coding practices

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology & Secure Design Considerations

Each cryptographic function was developed or analyzed based on the following principles:

- **Key Management:** Use of dynamic key generation, non-reuse of IVs
- **Authentication:** Use of HMACs and GCM tags for integrity
- **Randomness:** Cryptographically secure RNGs over Math.random()
- **Defense-in-depth:** Defense via algorithm choice, UI validation, and API design
- **Insecure-by-design analysis:** Files labeled `ToFix` were intentionally flawed to reinforce real-world attack mitigation

---

## üß© Sample Fix Task

One key assignment was correcting `AESblockcipherToFix.html`, which reused the same IV across encryptions ‚Äî a critical vulnerability. The fix involved:
- Generating a new **random IV** for each session
- Using **WebCrypto AES-CBC** with proper padding
- Encoding outputs with Base64 to avoid corruption
- Implementing a secure key derivation function (KDF) for consistency
